# Office-Day-Planner
Day Planner for office hours.
I made 4 files
==>index.html
   This file contains the infrastructure of the Office-Day-Planner
   with heading and current date on the top of the page
   created the table in the 2nd div where time display on left, text content in the middle and save button on right.
   there are the links of css, js and jquery files  
==>style.css
   I did the basic style on the page like background color, text color, width, height etc
==>script.js
   All the dynamic part of the app was done here. 
   created different functions, arrays, loops and conditions....
   the background color of the text content changes according to current time.
   if the time has passed it would be grey, if the time is in present the color is green and if the time is in future the color is blue.
   when the user press save your task button the task is saved in the local storage of the computer.
   even after refreshing or rerturning to the page the task will be on the text content fromm the local storage.  
==>moment.min.js
   Moment. js is a free and open source JavaScript library that removes the need to use the native JavaScript Date object directly. i used it for current date and current hour.
